# 💖 Valentine's Day SPA - Deployment Guide

Since you don't have Git installed on your computer, here is the easiest way to put your site online using GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Click the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `san-valentin-gift`).
4. Make sure it is **Public**.
5. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 3: Upload Your Files
1. On your new repository page, look for the link that says **uploading an existing file**.
2. Click on it.
3. Drag and drop all the files from your folder `c:\Users\Demol\Desktop\sanvalentinnn` into the browser window.
   - Make sure to include `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and the `image/` and `playlist/` folders.
4. Wait for the files to upload.
5. In the "Commit changes" box, type "Initial commit" and click **Commit changes**.

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Once your files are uploaded, go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. On the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and click **Save**.
4. Wait a minute or two, and refresh the page. You will see a link at the top saying:
   > "Your site is live at https://[your-username].github.io/san-valentin-gift/"

## Step 5: Share the Link!
Send that link to your best friend! 💌
